# Database Migration Notes

## Issue Summary
When implementing the duplicate detection feature, the database schema was updated to include a `fileHash` column. This required recreating the database, which resulted in:

1. **"Failed to fetch" errors** - This happens because users need to authenticate first
2. **Empty file list** - Previous file records were lost when the database was recreated
3. **Backup available** - The original database was saved as `noti.db.backup`

## Current Status
✅ **Database migrated successfully** - New schema includes duplicate detection
✅ **Duplicate detection working** - Hash-based and filename-based detection active
✅ **Authentication required** - Users must login to access the dashboard
✅ **Original data backed up** - Available in `noti.db.backup`

## For Users Experiencing Issues

### 1. Authentication Required
The "Failed to fetch" error occurs because you need to authenticate:
- Go to `/login` in your browser
- Click "Enter Dashboard" to create a session
- You'll then be able to access the files page

### 2. File List Empty
The file list is empty because the database was recreated. Your files are still available:
- **Audio files**: Still in `data/audio_files/` directory
- **Transcripts**: Still in `data/transcripts/` directory
- **Database backup**: Available in `data/noti.db.backup`

### 3. Options to Restore Files
You can either:
- **Option A**: Re-upload files (duplicate detection will prevent duplicates)
- **Option B**: Use the migration script to restore file records (technical)

## Migration Script Usage (Advanced)
```bash
# Make sure you have the dependencies
npm install better-sqlite3

# Run the migration script
node migrate-data.js
```

## What the Migration Adds
- **Duplicate Detection**: SHA-256 hash-based content comparison
- **Filename + Size Checking**: Prevents similar files from being uploaded
- **User Confirmation**: Shows duplicate dialog before upload
- **Database Indexes**: Optimized for fast duplicate lookups

## Benefits Going Forward
- **No More Duplicates**: System prevents duplicate file uploads
- **Storage Efficiency**: Saves disk space and processing time
- **Better User Experience**: Clear feedback on duplicate files
- **Flexible Control**: Option to allow duplicates when needed

## Next Steps
1. **Login** to access the dashboard
2. **Re-upload** any files you need (duplicates will be detected)
3. **Enjoy** the new duplicate detection feature!

The system is now fully operational with enhanced duplicate detection capabilities.
